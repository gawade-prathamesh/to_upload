Subject: Request for Salary Hike â€“ Addressing Discrepancies

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I would like to discuss my current compensation and request a salary adjustment. I have thoroughly evaluated my situation and have outlined a few points to help explain my request.

1. **Long Delay in Salary Hike**: Since joining the company 1.5 years ago, I have only received one salary hike. This increase was lower than I had anticipated and does not reflect my contributions and growth during this time.

2. **Disparity with New Hires**: I joined the company as a fresher, and it has come to my attention that new hires, who are at the same level as I was when I joined, are now being offered higher salaries than what I currently receive. This disparity is concerning, especially considering the experience and expertise I have gained during my tenure here.

3. **Below Industry Standards**: My research indicates that my current salary falls below industry standards for someone in my position and with my level of experience. I believe that aligning my compensation with industry benchmarks is essential to retain talent and motivation.

4. **Cost of Living in a Metro City**: Living in a metropolitan area is inherently more expensive, and my current salary does not adequately address the rising cost of living in the city. An adjustment in my compensation would greatly help me maintain a decent standard of living.

5. **Consistent Project Contribution**: I have been consistently billable on projects since completing my training. I have not spent any time on the bench, which demonstrates my commitment and value to the company. I believe my dedication to client projects should be reflected in my compensation.

I am truly dedicated to the success of our team and the company as a whole. I believe that an adjustment in my salary will not only acknowledge my contributions but also motivate me to continue delivering excellent results.

I kindly request a meeting at your earliest convenience to discuss this matter in more detail. I am open to any suggestions or insights you may have and look forward to finding a mutually beneficial solution.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
